# Simple Task Management System

A comprehensive task management application built with Laravel 12 and modern frontend technologies, featuring both list and Kanban board views for optimal task organization.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a technical assessment to demonstrate proficiency in Laravel architecture, JavaScript/AJAX implementation, and modern web development practices. The application provides a complete task management solution with user authentication, CRUD operations, and advanced UI features.

## Development Approach

### 1. **Architecture & Design Patterns**

#### **MVC Implementation**

-   **Models**: Clean Eloquent models with proper relationships and attribute casting
-   **Controllers**: RESTful controllers following single responsibility principle
-   **Views**: Blade components for reusable UI elements and maintainable templates

#### **Service Layer Pattern**

-   Implemented `TaskService` class to encapsulate business logic
-   Separation of concerns between controllers and business operations
-   Centralized query logic for better maintainability

#### **Repository Pattern Elements**

-   Service classes act as data access abstractions
-   Consistent API for task operations across different contexts

### 2. **Database Design**

#### **Migration Strategy**

-   Clean, focused migration for tasks table with proper column types
-   Enum-based status field for data integrity
-   Foreign key relationships with users table

#### **Model Implementation**

-   Used Laravel's native enum casting for type safety
-   Proper fillable attributes and relationships
-   Factory classes for testing and seeding with realistic sample data

#### **Testing & Development Data**

-   **DatabaseSeeder**: Creates test user and sample tasks for development
-   **TaskFactory**: Generates realistic task data with random titles, descriptions, and due dates
-   **UserFactory**: Standard Laravel user factory with proper password hashing

### 3. **Validation & Security**

#### **Form Request Classes**

-   `TaskStoreRequest`: Comprehensive validation for task creation/updating
-   `TaskStatusUpdateRequest`: Dedicated validation for status changes
-   Custom validation rules (`TaskStatusRule`) for enum validation

#### **Authorization**

-   Gate-based authorization for task operations
-   User ownership verification for all task actions
-   Middleware protection for authenticated routes

### 4. **Frontend Architecture**

#### **JavaScript Organization**

-   Modular JavaScript with separate files for different functionalities
-   `tasks.js`: Core task operations and AJAX handling
-   `kanban.js`: Drag-and-drop Kanban board functionality
-   Global configuration for CSRF tokens and toast notifications

#### **UI/UX Implementation**

-   **Bootstrap 5**: Modern, responsive design
-   **Blade Components**: Reusable form inputs and UI elements
-   **Dual View System**: Both list and Kanban board interfaces
-   **Real-time Feedback**: Toast notifications and loading states

### 5. **Advanced Features Implementation**

#### **Drag-and-Drop Kanban Board**

-   jQuery UI integration for smooth drag-and-drop experience
-   Real-time status updates via AJAX
-   Visual feedback during drag operations
-   Automatic board state management

#### **Search & Filtering**

-   Server-side filtering by status and keywords
-   Real-time search with immediate results
-   Sort functionality (newest/oldest)
-   URL-based filter persistence

#### **AJAX Integration**

-   Complete AJAX implementation for all CRUD operations
-   Non-blocking UI updates
-   Error handling with user-friendly messages
-   Progress indicators for better UX
